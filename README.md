# WSN-Mesh

A Wireless Sensor Network project implementing a mesh topology. The network consists of multiple ESP8266 nodes and one ESP32 gateway.
Each ESP8266 node can relay data to other nearby nodes, forming a self-healing, multi-hop communication network. The ESP32 acts as the central gateway that collects aggregated data from the mesh.
